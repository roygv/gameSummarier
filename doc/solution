          <p class="lead">Roy's Thoughts: #1: How you identify and classify key events in and features from a game? #2: How do we determine what is interesting and what is not? Chirons, audio, crowd reaction, scene detection, k-means. Walk through why we chose what we chose. Think of the crowd as a language we are trying to codify. #3: Rank the most interesting moments. #4: Creating a compelling clip that captures the content concisely. #5: Delivery. Run model on new video, collect end points, and based on # of points or total length we encode a short-form video that the user can watch. #6: Technology used and features used and algorithms used and pipeline if applicable -- how we solved the problem. We chose soccer -- let us tell you why. #7: Demo if applicable.<br></br>Pre-existing paragraph: Provide great short-form content that surpasses the fidelity of sports highlights and gives sports fans a short, but immersive, foray into their preferred sporting events. This section will become rife with detail about our process, model, and pipeline.<br></br>I suspect we will want a visualization of our data pipeline here, as well as images for PCA and error breakdowns. Then we will want to show "analysis of a game" and show top highlights I also like putting "technologies used" in this section. This is where we should link to Jupyter Notebook.</p>
