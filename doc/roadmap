          <p class="lead">Roy's Thoughts: #1: Delivery mechanism. The PVR option -- Best on PVR or "on the box" or used by the owner of the content server. Install on content owner's site -- Perhaps a subscription service, or a benefit for a paid service. Summary factory and client app -- download the content on a massive scale and create summary files and serve index files to a browser app. Curated stream -- Snapchat/Facebook feed option #2: Algorithm improvements. #3: Tailor clips to the time the user has available. Get more data. #4 Re-emphasize the value of the algorithm and close with compelling outro for the project.<br></br>This could be a paragraph or a list. On it would be -- more data and tapping into neural networks to improve classification; increased fidelity of piecing stories together via algorithm improvements and scene detection and chirons and etc. Getting the games to be great, to make selling [or open sourcing] the algorithm more appealing. We could have a separate tab for this, but we should have a "Why Sports Highlighter" section that re-emphasizes why we think the project is so promising and ties together everything we presented above.</p>
