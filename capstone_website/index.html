          <h3 class="featurette-heading">The Problem</h3>
          <p class="lead">Roy's thoughts: Global, everywhere, huge market. #2: People spend a lot of money on sports. #3: People spend a lot of time watching it. #4: The bottleneck is time -- there is more and more content, but time to watch is not increasing. #5: There is a clear opportunity to reduce the time it takes to watch great content.<br></br>Pre-existing paragraph: There are more than a billion sports fans across the world, and most don't have the time to watch the amount of sports footage as they'd like each week. In addition, the world is becoming more and more mobile-focused, so there is a clear need to create more (and better) short-form content to help shortcut oversupply and meet growing demand.<br></br>Realistically, we should have some kind of story in data here that has a non-text-based format, so the page flows better. Speak to market size and revenue size and engagement.<br></br>End of problem section should be "what we propose to do to solve the problem."</p>

          <h3 class="featurette-heading">Our Solution</h3>
          <p class="lead">Roy's Thoughts: #1: How you identify and classify key events in and features from a game? #2: How do we determine what is interesting and what is not? Chirons, audio, crowd reaction, scene detection, k-means. Walk through why we chose what we chose. Think of the crowd as a language we are trying to codify. #3: Rank the most interesting moments. #4: Creating a compelling clip that captures the content concisely. #5: Delivery. Run model on new video, collect end points, and based on # of points or total length we encode a short-form video that the user can watch. #6: Technology used and features used and algorithms used and pipeline if applicable -- how we solved the problem. We chose soccer -- let us tell you why. #7: Demo if applicable.<br></br>Pre-existing paragraph: Provide great short-form content that surpasses the fidelity of sports highlights and gives sports fans a short, but immersive, foray into their preferred sporting events. This section will become rife with detail about our process, model, and pipeline.<br></br>I suspect we will want a visualization of our data pipeline here, as well as images for PCA and error breakdowns. Then we will want to show "analysis of a game" and show top highlights I also like putting "technologies used" in this section. This is where we should link to Jupyter Notebook.</p>

          <h3 class="featurette-heading">Roadmap</h3>
          <p class="lead">Roy's Thoughts: #1: Delivery mechanism. Best on PVR or "on the box" or used by the owner of the content server. Perhaps a subscription service, or a benefit for a paid service. #2: Algorithm improvements. #3: Tailor clips to the time the user has available. Get more data. #4 Re-emphasize the value of the algorithm and close with compelling outro for the project.<br></br>This could be a paragraph or a list. On it would be -- more data and tapping into neural networks to improve classification; increased fidelity of piecing stories together via algorithm improvements and scene detection and chirons and etc. Getting the games to be great, to make selling [or open sourcing] the algorithm more appealing. We could have a separate tab for this, but we should have a "Why Sports Highlighter" section that re-emphasizes why we think the project is so promising and ties together everything we presented above.</p>
